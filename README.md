## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Problem Statement:

Movie and TV platformsâ€™ recommender systems are a hit or miss (Partly caused by all of the anime films watched by one of the nine friends who share your account.)  

Trailer Park allows users to create a collection of trailers by simply searching movies and shows and saving them to a personalized library.  Users can also curate Movie/TV playlists based on other Trailer Park users and their Trailer Libraries.
